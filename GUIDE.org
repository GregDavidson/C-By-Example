*** Exercise challenge:
Change PutInt so that it prints large integers with commas to group the digits
  - groups can have up to 3 digits
  - or the convention used in your country
Hints:
- Add a new parameter to PutPosInt which tracks your position
- PutInt should pass a 0 to initialize the new parameter
- Be /Maximally Lazy/: each call to PutPosInt should
  - either print a single digit
  - or a single comma 
  - or print nothing!
** [[file:Programs/getline1.c][getline1.c]]
A more common but maybe less clear version:
 [[file:Programs/getline.c][getline.c]]
*** Exercise challenges:
1. Redesign so that the caller can specify a limit to how much space will be
   allowed for the the size of the dynamically allocated array
  - What should happen if the line is too long?

3. Redesign so that instead of each instance of getline holding on to only 1
   input character until it's time to put it into the final array, it instead
   has a small fixed-size array which can hold several characters.
   - The new getline should only delegate to a new getline if and when its small
     array is full and more characters remain in the input line.
   - All input characters need to placed into the final dynamically allocated
     array as before.
