Directory: c-by-example

These are materials for a course teaching the C Programming Language using
a graduated series of examples and exercises accompanied by commentary,
rules, tables and hand-outs.

All materials in this directory are:
	Copyright (c) 2000-2009 J. Greg Davidson.
	All rights reserved.

The course is intended to be facilitated by a live instructor and these
materials are not ready for wide dissemination, so please do not pass them
on without checking with me first.

If you are trying to use these materials for self-study:
1.	Look at each program in the order they are listed in the
	file PROGRAM-LIST.
2.	Make and run each program, e.g.  from a Unix-like shell
	where "$" is the command prompt:

	$	more hello1.c
	$	make hello1
	$	./hello1

	The make program will run the C Compiler for you, translating
	your program to the machine language of your computer, creating
	a new program which you can run by simply saying where it is,
	e.g. "./" for "in this directory".  In Unix-like systems there is
	no extension for programs, so "hello1.c" is a textfile containing
	the C language source of a program simply named "hello1".

3.	If the result of running the program is interesting or
	confusing, experiment with the program and/or discuss it with
	someone else.  You can freely edit any of the programs with any
	text editor - I recommend emacs if you have it.  If you make a
	mistake, the compiler may give you error messages or the program
	may misbehave - it's important to make lots of mistakes!

I'm hoping to add to this collection some other one-page programs which
do more interesting things, such as:

- Play existing audio, video and graphics files
- Transform existing audio, video and graphics files
- Generate brand new audio, video and graphics dynamically
- A simple web browser
- A simple web client and web robot
- A database client

I have examples of all of the above which need to be stripped
of inessential features and cleaned up to be good examples.

I also hope to accompany these examples with web pages including
diagrams and animations which move this into becoming a free Web
course which would be fun for any individual or small group to 

I'm looking for people who would enjoy helping with this and
similar projects, so please let me know if this interests you!

Enjoy,

J. Greg Davidson
