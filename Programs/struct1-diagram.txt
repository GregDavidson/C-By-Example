Diagram for C-By-Example/Programs/struct1.c

This file MUST be viewed with a monospace font!
Number and age will occupy 1 machine word, minimum 2 bytes, typically 4 or 8 bytes.
There is no separation between fields, so the | separators don't really exist!
The integer values would really be in binary.
The second diagram shows the reality using a hex digit for each four bits.
The datatype definition occupies no storage at runtime.

Datatype definition at compile time on a 64-bit machine:
- each _ represents an 8-bit byte
struct employee
________|______________________|________|____________
number   name                   age      ssn

In the stackframe after function main has been called:
- as we might imagine the values on a 64-bit machine
main/newguy
____3903|New_guy_______________|______18|111-222-3333
number   name                   age      ssn

In the stackframe after function main has been called:
- assuming a 32-bit machine with each __ representing 1 byte
- in binary rendered as hexidecimal so 2-hex digits per byte
main/newguy
